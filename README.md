data-science-agent
A command-line toolkit to streamline solving Kaggle competitions.
This project is designed as a collection of focused scripts—starting with data acquisition—and will grow to include exploration, modeling, and more.

Current Functionality
get_kaggle_data
Fetches any Kaggle competition dataset and prepares it for analysis:
- Idempotent download and unzip of raw CSV files
- Conversion of CSV → Parquet with optional anonymization of Name, Ticket, and Cabin columns
- Reporting of directory sizes, DataFrame shapes, and data types
- Handling of existing train/test splits or sampling a held-out test set
This script lives in get_kaggle_data.py and can be invoked on any competition slug.

Installation
Use a Python 3.8+ environment:
git clone https://github.com/your-org/data-science-agent.git
cd data-science-agent

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt


Create a .env file next to get_kaggle_data.py with your Kaggle API credentials:
KAGGLE_USERNAME=your_username
KAGGLE_KEY=your_key



Usage
Run the data-acquisition script with a competition slug:
python get_kaggle_data.py titanic --test-size 0.2


This produces the following structure under data/titanic/:
data/
└── titanic/
    ├── raw/              # Downloaded CSV files
    └── processed/
        ├── *.parquet     # Converted and anonymized Parquet files
        └── splits/
            ├── train.parquet
            └── test.parquet


Re-running the same command is safe and will skip already-completed steps.
Use --help to view options:
python get_kaggle_data.py --help
